# Problem Solving Philosophy

**Motivation**: In this era of information overload and AI , I believe owning the ability to think critically, absorb information effectively, and learn rapidly is the key.

**About this repository**: This repository is an attempt to find systematic problem-solving frameworks and train myself to have the abilities mentioned above.

The content have been breaking into two categories primarily

- **Problem Solving Frameworks**

  - How to solve well-defined problems
  - How to solve ill-defined problems

- **Problem Solving, Domain Knowledge, and Experience**
  - How to identify the overview of domain knowledge systematically
  - How to apply problem-solving frameworks to specific domain problems
